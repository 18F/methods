title: Contextual inquiry
category: Discover
what: The product team unobtrusively observes participants at work, with their permission, then asks questions.
why: To learn how and why users do what they do; to discover needs and attitudes that might not emerge in an <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/">interview</a> to map how tools, digital and otherwise, interact during complex activities.
timeRequired: 1-2 hours per user
how:
  - With permission from a supervisor and from the participant, schedule a time to watch a typical work activity and record data.
  - While observing, ask the participant to act normally. Pretend you’re a student learning how to do the job. Ask questions to help you understand what the person is doing and why.
  - At the end of the session, explain what you have learned and check for errors.
  - Immediately after, write up your notes.
