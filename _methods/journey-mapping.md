## How to do it

1. Document the elements of the project's design context. This includes:
  - People involved and their related goals
  - Their behaviors in pursuit of their goals
  - Information, devices, and services that support their behaviors
  - Important moments in how they experience a service or major decisions they make
  - The emotions associated with these moments or decisions
2. Visualize the order in which people exhibit behaviors, use information, make decisions, and feel emotions. Group elements into a table of "phases" related to the personal narrative of each [persona](/decide/personas/#personas). Identify where personas share contextual components.
3. Discuss the map with stakeholders. Point out insights it offers. Use these insights to establish [design principles](/decide/design-principles/#design-principles). Think about how to collapse or accelerate a customer's journey through the various phases. Incorporate this information into the project's scope.
