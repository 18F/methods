layout: card
title: Mental modelling
category: Decide
what: A simple reference model that correlates existing and potential interfaces with user behaviors.
why: To help designers anticipate how design decisions might facilitate future behaviors.
timeRequired: 1–2 hours
how:
  - Create one three-columned table per persona. Label the columns “Past,” “Present Behavior,” and “Future.”
  - In the middle column (Present Behavior), list current user behaviors and pain points broadly related to the project, one per row.
  - In the left-hand column (Past), list the products, services, features, and/or interfaces that the user encounters as they go about what’s listed in the Present Behavior column.
  - In the right-hand column (Future), list possible products, services, features, and/or interface elements that in the future might change behaviors and pain points in the Present Behavior column.
governmentConsiderations:
  No PRA implications. No information is collected from members of the public.
