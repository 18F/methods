title: Task flow analysis
description: A step-by-step analysis of how a user will interact with a system in order to reach a goal. This analysis is documented in a diagram that traces a user's possible paths through sequences of tasks and decision points in pursuit of their goal. The tasks and decision points should represent steps taken by the user, as well as steps taken by the system.
category: Decide
what: A step-by-step analysis of how a user will interact with a system in order to reach a goal. This analysis is documented in a diagram that traces a user's possible paths through sequences of tasks and decision points in pursuit of their goal. The tasks and decision points should represent steps taken by the user, as well as steps taken by the system.
why: To validate a design team's understanding of users' goals, common scenarios, and tasks, and to illustrate in a solution-agnostic way the overall flow of tasks through which a user progresses to accomplish a goal.  Task flow diagrams also help surface obstacles in the way of users achieving their goal. 
timeRequired: 1-2 hours per user goal
how:
  <ol>
    <li>Based on user research, identify target users' goals that need to be analyzed.</li>
    <li>For each goal, identify common scenarios and the tasks and decisions that the user or system will perform in each scenario. Don’t make assumptions about which steps are understood.</li>
    <li>Produce a taskflow diagram that includes each task and decision point that a user might encounter on their way toward their goal. The diagram should cover the common scenarios identified in step 2.  </li>
    <li>Present the diagram to a subject matter expert who knows the task(s) well enough to check for accuracy.</li>
    <li>In collaboration with users and/or subject matter exprts, annotate the task flow diagram to pinpoint areas of interest, risk, or potential frustration.</li>    
  </ol>
