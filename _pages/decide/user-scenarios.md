## What it is

Stories and context — focused on identifying the what, who, how, and why — behind why a specific user or user group comes to your site.

## Reasons to use it

To remind a team, during both the design and validation phases, of the overarching goal(s) that users have when interacting with a solution. Scenarios help the team consider the design of the solution as a whole rather than getting caught up by specific pages, elements, or interactions. They note questions and goals and sometimes define the possibilities of how the user(s) can achieve them.

## Time required

**Small:** 1-3 hours

## How to do it

1. Identify the target user group and any common user goals and scenarios that a person must go through when interacting with a solution.

2. Decide which type of scenario you’re going to write.
  - Goal or task-based: Short and specific, focus on the core aspects of the goal or task.
  - Elaborate: Provide additional details about the environment and context.
  - Full scale: Include various steps a user needs to take as well as their environment and context.

3. Describe why it’s important for a user to be able to accomplish their goal or complete the scenario.

4. Share with the full team for feedback and refinement.

5. If you want to use the scenarios for [usability testing](/../validate/usability-testing/), write them so they do not lead the participant to the correct outcome.
