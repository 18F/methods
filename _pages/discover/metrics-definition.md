## What it is

A collaborative effort to define problems through a focus on goals and the criteria by which a team will measure a solution’s impact on those problems.

## Reasons to use it

To keep the team vigilant about the user’s perspective and to establish a user-centered framework for passively measuring over time. Research keeps us vigilant about building metrics that emphasize the user’s perspective rather than metrics that make us appear good at our jobs.

## Time required

**Small:** 1–2 hours

## How to do it

1. Describe the existing situation to the team, including who the stakeholders are and what their stake is.

2. Use [personas]({{ '/decide/personas/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to identify users’ skills, practices, and behaviors. Decide which you want to promote (and how you would measure that). Next, look at personas’ pain points and consider how you would alleviate them (and how you would measure that).

3. Anonymously collect the team’s greatest hopes and fears. Print these out, group them by topic, and discuss. Think about how you can measure throughout the project whether it is aligning with your collective hopes or deviating toward your collective fears.

4. Craft a problem statement:

  *We have observed that [product/service/organization] isn’t meeting [these goals/needs], which is causing [this adverse effect]. How might we improve so that our team/organization is more successful based on [these measurable criteria]?*
