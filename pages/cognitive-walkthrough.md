## What it is

An evaluation method in which evaluators or potential users who are unfamiliar with a design work through a set of representative tasks and ask questions about the task as they go.

## Reasons to use it

To understand whether a design solution is easy for a new or infrequent user to learn, and why it is or isn’t easy.

## Time required

**Medium:** 30 minutes to one hour per person

## How to do it

1. Identify specific traits for new or infrequent users of a design solution.

2. Develop a set of representative tasks that emphasize new use or infrequent use.

3. Recruit three to five users for each of the traits you’ve identified to participant in a moderated usability testing session. (The traits can overlap.)

4. Ask the user to accomplish their goal using a printed or interactive design. As they go, ask what they would attempt to do next or how they would learn.
 - Don't lead the user through the task, but encourage them to stay focused on what they’re trying to accomplish.
 - Pay attention to expected outcomes and how quickly/easily participants are able to pick up a task.

5. Analyze the walkthrough results to highlight what users learned easily and what needs improvement.

## Applied in government research

-  No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (e.g., not a survey) that a cognitive walkthrough entails, 5 CFR 1320.5(h)3.
-  If you are not working with government employees, you will need to observe standard precautions for archiving personally identifiable information.
