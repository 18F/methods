## What it is

A detailed review of existing experiences provided either by direct competitors or by related agencies or services.

## Reasons to use it

To identify competitors’ solutions that excel, are lacking, or are missing critical design elements. Comparative analysis can give new solutions a competitive edge by identifying areas of opportunity, gaps in experience offerings, and potential design patterns to adopt or avoid.

## Time required

**Medium:** 1–2 hours per identified competitor. One hour to analyze each competitor. 4–8 hours total to generate a report.

## How to do it

1. Identify a list of services or agencies that would be either direct or related competitors to the service or client agency. Pare the list down to four or five.

2. Establish which heuristics you will use to evaluate each service or agency offering.

3. Break down the analysis of each selected competitor into specific focal areas for evaluation. For example, how relevant are search results?

4. Use a spreadsheet to capture the evaluation and determine how the targeted services and agencies perform based on the identified heuristics.

5. Present the analysis, which should showcase areas of opportunities that you can take advantage of and design patterns you might adopt or avoid.

## Applied in government research

No PRA implications. No information is collected from members of the public.
