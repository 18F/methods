## What it is

A facilitated exercise in which participants list their individual priorities onto cards, collect them as a group, organize them by relationship, and establish group priorities through individual voting.

## Reasons to use it

To reach a consensus on priorities of subjective, qualitative data with a group of people. This is especially helpful with larger groups of stakeholders and groups with high risk of disagreement.

## Time required

**Small:** 1–2 hours

## How to do it

1. Gather at least four participants for 90 minutes. Provide Post-It notes and markers.

2. Determine a focus question and assign a facilitator.

3. Give participants five minutes to write at least three responses to the focus question, each on its own note.

4. Give participants 15 minutes to put their answers on the wall and read everyone’s contributions. Additions are welcome. Have participants cluster similar answers together without discussion.

5. Ask participants to write a name for each cluster on their own. Each participant must give each cluster a name. They may also split clusters.

6. Put every single name on the wall with its cluster. Exclude only word-for-word duplicates.

7. Remind participants of the original question. Instruct each person to rank their three most important clusters. Visually tally points.

8. Combine duplicate areas and their points if the group unanimously agrees they are identical. At the end, three or four groups usually rank much higher than the rest. Make these the top priorities for the focus question.

## Applied in government research

At 18F, KJ participants are almost always federal employees. If there is any chance your KJ workshop could include participants who are *not* federal employees, consult OMB guidance on the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Privacy Act. Your agencies’ Office of General Counsel, and perhaps OIRA desk officers also can ensure you are following the laws and regulations applicable to federal agencies.

## Example from 18F

18F conducted this exercise with 20 Federal Election Commission staff members to define priorities around conflicting requests. We used this method to get data from staff (not the decision makers) about what they saw as the most pressing needs. We synthesized and presented the data back to the decision makers.
