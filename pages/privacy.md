## What it is

Our obligation to keep data about research participants secure. Covered by laws like the Privacy Act, Federal Information Security Management Act and eGovernment Act.

## Why it is important

You have a moral, legal, and ethical obligation to protect people’s privacy. Also, if people do not believe you will protect their privacy, they will be unlikely to participate in your research.

## How to do it:

When you do have to collect or store personally identifiable information, comply with all the legal requirements. Those planning usability testing should consult with their agencies’ Office of General Counsel to ensure that the usability testing is carried out consistent with applicable laws and regulations.
